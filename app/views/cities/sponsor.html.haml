        We've managed to get some great sponsors to cover the costs of
        the venue and catering, but we're still looking for sponsors to
        help cover the other costs incurred when running an event.

      %dl
        %dt Merchandise
        %dd Rails Girls branded swag bags, name badges, posters, balloons, stickers

        %dt Travel subsidies
        %dd For special guests and speakers

        %dt Post-workshop support
        %dd Frequent sessions to help keep the momentum

      %p
        Without the support of businesses within the community, we would not
        be able to make the impact we already have. Contributions at any level are
        welcomed.

        == Another way to sponsor Rails Girls #{@city.name} is to provide the venue and
        catering for a future event. We currently run large Workshops, and small
        Weekly meetings, and the requirements for each differ.

      %p
        == If you're interested in doing this, please get in touch at
        #{mail_to @city.email}, and we'll be happy to arrange something.
